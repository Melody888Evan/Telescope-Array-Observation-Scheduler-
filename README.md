### Implementation

The specific steps of cross-matching for two astronomical catalogues are shown in the following figure. 

<P align="center"><img src=figs/model.png hidth="48%" width="70%"></img></p>

First the **Extraction module** extracts celestial position information (mainly RA, DEC) from the input data and filters out useless information. The **First-level partition module** divides the extracted location information into HEALPix data blocks, while our quad-direction strategy is implemented in the **Boundary processing module** to reduce the loss of accuracy without adding too much redundant data. Then through **Second-level partition module**, calculation blocks can be obtained for storing and subsequent parallel accessing catalogue records on GPU. **Source reading module** is designed to retrieve the current CPU and GPU computing status to dynamically adjust splitting strategy. On the GPU, the inter-catalogue parallelization is adopted to calculate the radius distances on **Kernel module** with I/O optimizations on the **Compression module**. Finally, the matching results transferred to CPU will be exported the final products and be visualized. This function is under development. 


## Installation

### Dependencies

- CUDA Toolkit: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive

### Build from source

1. Change the direction to 'HLC2' directory

2. Update the library file paths in the Makefile according to the paths of installed dependencies.

3. Generate an executable file named Crossmatch: make

4. To clear the files generated by the last make command, run this command: make clean

## Getting Started

### Minimal example

1. After successful compilation, do the following thing for cross-matching performance testing:

```shell
$  ./Crossmatch ../data_sample/sample1_sdss.csv ../data_sample/sample2_sdss.csv 
```
The cross-matching time of the two catalogues will be printed in the console.

2. If you want to get the cross-matching result, use the following command:

```shell
$  ./Crossmatch ../data_sample/sample1_sdss.csv ../data_sample/sample2_sdss.csv result.txt
```
Successfully matched catalogue record pairs are printed in the specified output file.
